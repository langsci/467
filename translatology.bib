	abstract = {The paper develops a definition of translation literality that is based on the syntactic and semantic similarity of the source and the target texts. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that absolute literal translations are easy to produce. Based on a multilingual corpus of alternative translations we investigate the effects of cross-lingual syntactic and semantic distance on translation production times and find that non-literality makes from-scratch translation and post-editing difficult. We show that statistical machine translation systems encounter even more difficulties with non-literality.},

By contextualising the case study within the past and current developments of translation and interpreting technology research, this book seeks to inform and inspire a redefinition of the conceptualisation of interpreting technology research – not just as a tool to understand change but to drive it into a sustainable and human direction.},

	abstract = {Online collaborative translation experienced a meteoric rise in the e first decade of the 20th century thanks to the affordances provided by the Web 2.0. Two distinct models emerged, solicited and unsolicited models. In the first one a company or institutions request the help of volunteer or participants with translation tasks. In unsolicited models, fans, activists or different collectives self-organize to start a translation initiative. These practices quickly attracted the attention of the Language Industry after large corporations implemented crowdsourcing models (Google, Facebook or Twitter). Translation providers and tech companies explored collaborative initiatives in a context of exciting possibilities for growth, while it quickly became a serious cause for concern for professional translators and professional associations such as the International Federation of Translators (FIT) or the American Translators’ Association (ATA). As a rapidly growing phenomenon, Translation Studies scholars were quickly drawn to research this emerging set of phenomena. Initially, the main issues that appeared on Translation Studies literature were related to motivation, epistemological/ conceptual research, ethics, translator visibility, or the description of existing initiatives. The second decade of the 20th century saw the consolidation of these activities through technological developments and innovative workflows and the expansion to non-profit ventures, while new technology-driven models based on collaborative micro-task approaches emerged, such as “paid crowdsourcing”. By 2020, the number of providers offering translations crowdsourcing has been dramatically reduced.  Many start-ups have been absorbed or have disappeared, while non-for-profit models of translation collaboration, such as educational, NGO or activist initiatives continue to grow. This paper offers a critical analysis of the evolution of translation collaboration on the web and potential future directions, as well as a review of existing research trends within Translation Studies. The paper ends with an exploration of potential future research trends and directions in this ever-changing area driven by technological innovation.},

However, existing comparative studies between them mainly rely on automated metrics, raising questions into the feasibility of these metrics and their alignment with human judgment. The present study investigates the convergences and divergences between automated metrics and human evaluation in assessing the quality of machine translation from ChatGPT and three NMT systems. To perform automatic assessment, four automated metrics are employed, while human evaluation incorporates the DQF-MQM error typology and six rubrics. Notably, automatic assessment and human evaluation converge in measuring formal fidelity (e.g., error rates), but diverge when evaluating semantic and pragmatic fidelity, with automated metrics failing to capture the improvement of ChatGPT's translation brought by prompt engineering. These results underscore the indispensable role of human judgment in evaluating the performance of advanced translation tools at the current stage.},

	shorttitle = {Is {ChatGPT} a good translator?},
	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2301.08745},
	abstract = {This report provides a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT for machine translation, including translation prompt, multilingual translation, and translation robustness. We adopt the prompts advised by ChatGPT to trigger its translation ability and find that the candidate prompts generally work well with minor performance differences. By evaluating on a number of benchmark test sets, we find that ChatGPT performs competitively with commercial translation products (e.g., Google Translate) on high-resource European languages but lags behind significantly on low-resource or distant languages. As for the translation robustness, ChatGPT does not perform as well as the commercial systems on biomedical abstracts or Reddit comments but exhibits good results on spoken language. Further, we explore an interesting strategy named \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{pivot{\textasciitilde}prompting\}\$ for distant languages, which asks ChatGPT to translate the source sentence into a high-resource pivot language before into the target language, improving the translation performance noticeably. With the launch of the GPT-4 engine, the translation performance of ChatGPT is significantly boosted, becoming comparable to commercial translation products, even for distant languages. Human analysis on Google Translate and ChatGPT suggests that ChatGPT with GPT-3.5 tends to generate more hallucinations and mis-translation errors while that with GPT-4 makes the least errors. In other words, ChatGPT has already become a good translator. Please refer to our Github project for more details: https://github.com/wxjiao/Is-ChatGPT-A-Good-Translator},

For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model.  GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks. We also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora.},

People use the tool to translate texts from different areas of life, including work, study and leisure. Of these, the study area is currently the most prevalent. The results also reveal a tendency for users to machine translate documents that are in languages they have some understanding of, rather than texts they do not understand at all. The findings imply that gist MT is becoming a part of people's everyday lives and that perhaps people use gist MT in a different way than they use publishing-level translations.},

	abstract = {Five years after the first published proofs of concept, direct approaches to speech translation (ST) are now competing with traditional cascade solutions. In light of this steady progress, can we claim that the performance gap between the two is closed? Starting from this question, we present a systematic comparison between state-of-the-art systems representative of the two paradigms. Focusing on three language directions (English-German/Italian/Spanish), we conduct automatic and manual evaluations, exploiting high-quality professional post-edits and annotations. Our multi-faceted analysis on one of the few publicly available ST benchmarks attests for the first time that: i) the gap between the two paradigms is now closed, and ii) the subtle differences observed in their behavior are not sufficient for humans neither to distinguish them nor to prefer one over the other.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary Machine translation (MT) has become a multimillion dollar affair. Fully automatic, high quality translation is not a reasonable goal, not even for scientific texts. This chapter surveys the situations where translation involved has to be of high quality. A human translator, in order to arrive at his/her high quality output, is obliged to make intelligent use of extra linguistic knowledge that sometimes has to be of considerable breadth and depth. Reasonable goals are either fully automatic, low quality translation or partly automatic, or high quality translation. Full automation of the translation process is incompatible with high quality. The two possible directions where a compromise could be struck are sacrificing quality or reducing the self-sufficiency of the machine output. There are many situations where less than high quality machine output is satisfactory. However, when the aim of MT is lowered to that of high quality translation by a machine-post-editor partnership, the decisive problem becomes to determine the region of optimality in the continuum of possible divisions of labor. The exact position of this region will be a function of the state of linguistic analysis where the languages involved are submitted. With machine-time/efficiency becoming cheaper and human time becoming more expensive, continuous efforts will be made to push this region in the direction of reducing the human element. However, there is no good reason to assume that this region can be pushed to the end of the line, certainly not in the near future.},

The first period, which goes from 1967 to 1983, is a period of germination. The second period, covering the years between 1984 and 1993, is a period of steady growth. The third period, which is from 1993 to 2003, is a decade of rapid growth. The last period, which includes the years from 2004 to 2013, is a period of global development.},

Our hypothesis was that the use of the programme would have a positive impact on interpreting assignments. To carry out a case study, for some experiments the students prepared the vocabulary in advance without the use of the programme, and for other experiments the vocabulary was prepared using the programme. The results from the different groups of students were compared to see which of the groups performed better, the students who prepared the vocabulary with the use of the corpus management programme, or those who did not use the programme.},

Using text analysis tools, significant differences in multidimensional linguistic features including lexical, syntactic, and cohesive ones were shown between humans and machines but not between two artificial systems. Finer-grained statistical analyses indicated that human-machine differences in certain indices deviated in varied interpreting modes. Our data collectively revealed the strengths of human interpreters in audience-oriented communicative mediation but limitations in cognitive resources. By relating the findings to interpreting competence, the current research provides important implications for empowering students in adaptively resorting to human strengths and/or embracing machine translation technologies.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence-grounded machine translation has fundamentally changed public awareness and attitudes towards multilingual communication. In some language pairs, the accuracy, quality and efficiency of machine-translated texts of certain types can be quite high. Hence, the end-user acceptability and reliance on machine-translated content could be justified. However, machine translation in small and/or low-resource languages might yield significantly lower quality, which in turn may lead to potentially negative consequences and risks if machine translation is used in high-risk contexts without awareness of the drawbacks, critical assessment and modifications to the raw output. The current study, which is part of a more extensive project focusing on the societal impact of machine translation, is aimed at revealing the attitudes towards usability and quality as perceived from the end-user perspective. The research questions addressed revolve around the machine translation types used, purposes of using machine translation, perceived quality of the generated output, and actions taken to improve the quality by users with various backgrounds. The research findings rely on a survey of the population (N = 402) conducted in 2021 in Lithuania. The study reveals the frequent use of machine translation for a diversity of purposes. The most common uses include work, research and studies, and household environments. A higher level of education correlates with user dissatisfaction with the generated quality and actions taken to improve it. The findings also reveal that age correlates with the use of machine translation. Sustainable measures to reduce machine translation related risks have to be established based on the perceptions of different social groups in different societies and cultures.},

Academic interest in this field has intensified in recent years. However, there have been no thorough analyses of the definitions and classifications of CAI tools or of the empirical studies on the subject. This study overviews CAI tools holistically. It describes advances as well as gaps that remain to be filled. It also provides an in-depth examination of the status quo and suggests potential avenues for improvement. The article begins by distinguishing between CAI tools in the broad sense and CAI tools in the narrow sense. By bridging the conceptual gaps between the two, we propose a unified description and a categorisation that reflects the main features of CAI tools. This comprehensive review analyses 27 empirical studies and examines the manner in which CAI tools affect interpreters’ performance. Since the influencing factors that have been identified in previous experiments vary between interpreters-related (e.g. interpreters’ profiles) and settingsrelated (e.g. reference information display modes), the contribution of CAI tools to overall interpreter performance can be different. Product-driven, practice-driven, and process-driven studies are identified as future trends in studies of CAI tools.},

Together, these histories reveal some of the ways that various machineries were developed to “crack” unknown text, be it a foreign language or ciphertext. As such, this history also points to a deeper, ontological relationship between language and cryptology.},

            This paper discusses neural machine translation (NMT), a new paradigm in the MT field, comparing the quality of NMT systems with statistical MT by describing three studies using automatic and human evaluation methods. Automatic evaluation results presented for NMT are very promising, however human evaluations show mixed results. We report increases in fluency but inconsistent results for adequacy and post-editing effort. NMT undoubtedly represents a step forward for the MT field, but one that the community should be careful not to oversell.},

Targetside monolingual data plays an important role in boosting ﬂuency for phrasebased statistical machine translation, and we investigate the use of monolingual data for NMT. In contrast to previous work, which combines NMT models with separately trained language models, we note that encoder-decoder NMT architectures already have the capacity to learn the same information as a language model, and we explore strategies to train with monolingual data without changing the neural network architecture. By pairing monolingual training data with an automatic backtranslation, we can treat it as additional parallel training data, and we obtain substantial improvements on the WMT 15 task English↔German (+2.8–3.7 BLEU), and for the low-resourced IWSLT 14 task Turkish→English (+2.1–3.4 BLEU), obtaining new state-of-the-art results.

Both have been affected by the increasing availability of machine translation (MT): language learners now make use of free online MT to help them both understand and produce texts in a second language, but there are fears that uninformed use of the technology could undermine effective language learning. At the same time, MT is promoted as a technology that will change the face of professional translation, but the technical opacity of contemporary approaches, and the legal and ethical issues they raise, can make the participation of human translators in contemporary MT workflows particularly complicated. Against this background, this book attempts to promote teaching and learning about MT among a broad range of readers, including language learners, language teachers, trainee translators, translation teachers, and professional translators. It presents a rationale for learning about MT, and provides both a basic introduction to contemporary machine-learning based MT, and a more advanced discussion of neural MT. It explores the ethical issues that increased use of MT raises, and provides advice on its application in language learning. It also shows how users can make the most of MT through pre-editing, post-editing and customization of the technology.},

We investigate various strategies for choosing translation examples for few-shot prompting, concluding that example quality is the most important factor. Using optimized prompts, we revisit previous assessments of PaLM's MT capabilities with more recent test sets, modern MT metrics, and human evaluation, and find that its performance, while impressive, still lags that of state-of-the-art supervised systems.

	abstract = {1. Introduction When machine translation (MT) began to become popular in the late 1950s and early 1960s, people started looking for historical antecedents. Some traced its origins back to the 17th century, with the ideas of Descartes, Leibniz and other philosophers and scholars about universal, philosophical and 'logical' languages. However, while 'logical' languages can be seen as prerequisites for digital computer programs and while 'universal' languages can be regarded as forerunners of auxiliary languages such as Esperanto, of universal classification systems such as those of libraries and biological taxonomies, and even of interlinguas in machine translation itself, these ideas should not be considered in any way as embryonic automatic translation systems. Although one of the most worked out proposals for a 'universal' interlingua, the work of a German chemist Johann Joachim Becher in 1661, was publicised in a 1962 reprint as a program for machine translation (Becher 1962), it was in fact no more than a Latin vocabulary with a numerical notation. In principle, after similar glossaries for other languages had been provided (which Becher did not do), it could be used for the 'mechanical' conversion of lexical items in one language into 'equivalent' lexical items in another language. Of course, Becher did not and could not, given the state of technology at the time, even suggest how a mechanism could be constructed to do such conversion. Of all the philiosphical languages, the most detailed was the 'real character' of John Wilkins, published shortly afterwards in 1668. It was the most detailed attempt to construct a rational 'universal' notation for common concepts (Wilkins 1668), and it was in effect a proposal for an interlingua or a universal classification of concepts. But it was not a proposal for a method of automatic translation. It was not until the 20th century that the first practical suggestions for mechanical dictionaries could be made. There were apparently some rather vague proposals by an Estonian in 1924 for a typewriter-dictionary (Mel'čuk and Ravič 1967: 26), but the proposals which can legitimately be regarded as forerunners of machine translation are the patents applied for simultaneously in 1933, in France and Russia. In both cases the patents were for electromechanical devices capable of being used as translation dictionaries. The patent in France submitted by Georges Artsrouni was for a general-purpose machine which could also function, with some additional equipment, as a mechanical multilingual dictionary. The patent in …},

	volume = {6},
		doi = {10.3390/informatics6030041},
	abstract = {This study aims to analyse how translation experts from the German department of the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation (DGT) identify and correct different error categories in neural machine translated texts (NMT) and their post-edited versions (NMTPE). The term translation expert encompasses translator, post-editor as well as revisor. Even though we focus on neural machine-translated segments, translator and post-editor are used synonymously because of the combined workflow using CAT-Tools as well as machine translation. Only the distinction between post-editor, which refers to a DGT translation expert correcting the neural machine translation output, and revisor, which refers to a DGT translation expert correcting the post-edited version of the neural machine translation output, is important and made clear whenever relevant. Using an automatic error annotation tool and the more fine-grained manual error annotation framework to identify characteristic error categories in the DGT texts, a corpus analysis revealed that quality assurance measures by post-editors and revisors of the DGT are most often necessary for lexical errors. More specifically, the corpus analysis showed that, if post-editors correct mistranslations, terminology or stylistic errors in an NMT sentence, revisors are likely to correct the same error type in the same post-edited sentence, suggesting that the DGT experts were being primed by the NMT output. Subsequently, we designed a controlled eye-tracking and key-logging experiment to compare participants’ eye movements for test sentences containing the three identified error categories (mistranslations, terminology or stylistic errors) and for control sentences without errors. We examined the three error types’ effect on early (first fixation durations, first pass durations) and late eye movement measures (e.g., total reading time and regression path durations). Linear mixed-effects regression models predict what kind of behaviour of the DGT experts is associated with the correction of different error types during the post-editing process.},

	shorttitle = {Computer-assisted simultaneous interpreting},
	abstract = {The present work explores computer-assisted simultaneous interpreting (CASI) from a primarily cognitive perspective. Despite concerns over the potentially negative impact of computer-assisted interpreting (CAI) tools on interpreters’ cognitive load (CL), this hypothesis has thus far remained untested. Furthermore, previous research has been restricted to the evaluation of the CASI product. Hence, a methodology for the process-oriented evaluation of CASI and the empirical evidence for its cognitive modelling were missing. Overcoming these limitations appears essential to advance CAI research, particularly to foster a deeper understanding of the cognitive aspects of CAI through a validated research methodology and to determine the feasibility of the integration of CAI tools into the interpreting process. Therefore, this dissertation tested and empirically validated a methodology for the combined exploration of the product and process of CASI. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected during an eyetracking experiment at the Translation \&amp; Cognition Center of the University of Mainz. The study followed a convergent mixed-method and multi-method approach and involved nine MA advanced interpreting students. Prior to the experimental task, the informants were trained in the use of the three terminology support tools compared during the experiment, i. e. a digital glossary in PDF format, a CAI tool with manual look-up and a mock-up CAI tool with integrated automatic speech recognition (ASR) for terminology. After several pre-tests, the participants interpreted three speeches from English into their native German using a different tool each time. To increase comparability between the three conditions and control for potentially confounding variables, the speeches prepared ad-hoc for data collection were validated during a pilot study. The students’ gaze data and deliveries were recorded and analysed. Qualitative data on the informants’ perception of the tools were collected post-hoc. In the study, several performance, behavioural, and subjective measures were analysed: terminological accuracy and errors and omissions; glossary queries, ear-voice span, inter-cluster pause duration, time to first fixation, average fixation duration, and fixation time; qualitative questionnaire responses. The findings of this research provide first insights into the CASI process, in particular as it pertains to the effects of CAI tools on CL and attention allocation in interpreter-CAI tool interaction during simultaneous interpreting. As this is the first study on in-process CAI tool use with a markedly cognitive orientation, it entails significant implications for the methodological development of CAI research and the design of future studies on cognitive aspects of CASI, while raising additional questions in need of further investigation.},

Our work exposes the inherent cross-lingual vulnerability of these safety mechanisms, resulting from the linguistic inequality of safety training data, by successfully circumventing GPT-4's safeguard through translating unsafe English inputs into low-resource languages. On the AdvBenchmark, GPT-4 engages with the unsafe translated inputs and provides actionable items that can get the users towards their harmful goals 79\% of the time, which is on par with or even surpassing state-of-the-art jailbreaking attacks. Other high-/mid-resource languages have significantly lower attack success rate, which suggests that the cross-lingual vulnerability mainly applies to low-resource languages. Previously, limited training on low-resource languages primarily affects speakers of those languages, causing technological disparities. However, our work highlights a crucial shift: this deficiency now poses a risk to all LLMs users. Publicly available translation APIs enable anyone to exploit LLMs' safety vulnerabilities. Therefore, our work calls for a more holistic red-teaming efforts to develop robust multilingual safeguards with wide language coverage.},

On  a  broader  scale, management and the organisation of translation converge in the concept of translation policy, a still under-researched topic, which could prove to be a potentially rewarding field of action for translators.},

	doi = {10.5565/rev/tradumatica.288},
	abstract = {The field of translation is undergoing various profound changes. On the one hand it is being thoroughly reshaped by the advent and constant improvement of new technologies. On the other hand, new forms of translation are starting to see the light of day in the wake of social and legal developments that require that products and content that are created, are accessible for everybody. One of these new forms of translation, is audio description (AD), a service that is aimed at making audiovisual content accessible to people with sight loss. New legislation requires that this content is accessible by 2025, which constitutes a tremendous task given the limited number of people that are at present trained as audio describers. A possible solution would be to use machine translation to translate existing audio descriptions into different languages. Since AD is characterized by short sentences and simple, concrete language, it could be a good candidate for machine translation. In the present study, we want to test this hypothesis for the English-Dutch language pair. Three 30 minute AD excerpts of different Dutch movies that were originally audio described in English, were translated into Dutch using DeepL. The translations were analysed using the harmonized DQF-MQM error typology and taking into account the specific multimodal nature of the source text and the intersemiotic dimension of the original audio description process. The analysis showed that the MT output had a relatively high error rate, particularly in the categories of Accuracy – mistranslation and Fluency – grammar. This seems to indicate that extensive post-editing will be needed, before the text can be used in a professional context.},

After exploring the various subtitle parameters that can have an impact on the quality of the end product (such as line breaks, synchronisation, display rates), we present the results of two qualitative studies conducted with professional subtitlers and subtitle viewers with different audiovisual backgrounds. The results yield some similarities and discrepancies, particularly in the way in which the strategy of condensation is perceived by the two groups, and they also help delineate the subtitle parameters that should be taken into consideration in order to improve the creative process as well as the reception of subtitles.},

The generated subtitles need to conform to space and time requirements, while being synchronized with the speech and segmented in a way that facilitates comprehension. Given its considerable complexity, the task has so far been addressed through a pipeline of components that separately deal with transcribing, translating, and segmenting text into subtitles, as well as predicting timestamps. In this paper, we propose the first direct speech translation model for automatic subtitling that generates subtitles in the target language along with their timestamps with a single model. Our experiments on 7 language pairs show that our approach outperforms a cascade system in the same data condition, also being competitive with production tools on both in-domain and newly released out-domain benchmarks covering new scenarios.},

	abstract = {Machine translation is now making serious inroads into the field of interlingual subtitling. This has been made possible by the use of template files and higher reading speeds. As we move into this new phase in the development of the subtitling process, the phase of machine-translated and postedited subtitles, it is highly pertinent to look at marks that this new process leaves on the subtitled product, i.e., the subtitles themselves. We conducted a diachronic study of subtitles before and after machine translation was part of the process. We did this by comparing a corpus of Swedish subtitles of Anglophone TV programmes produced after machine translation was introduced to a corpus of subtitles from before that period. We also took data from studies of earlier processes into account. When assessed using existing guidelines and the FAR model, the post-edited subtitles produced in the 2020s were found to be faster, more oral, less cohesive, less complete and with less meticulous punctation and line-breaks than those produced in the 2010s. They were also of significantly lower quality in all areas investigated. Based on these results, we suggest that more research and development is needed to raise quality levels, and to make professional subtitlers augmented translators. Lay summary Machine translation is now starting to be used for subtitling from one language into another. This has been made possible by the use of higher reading speeds and recent technical innovations that simplify and automatise the process. As we move into this new phase in the development of the subtitling process, the phase of machine-translated subtitles which are then post-edited by humans, it is time to look at what marks this new process leaves on the subtitles themselves.

Results are compared to the translation outputs from the online ChatGPT. Our results show that, while the change of punctuation in the input yields great variability in the output translations, the context position does not seem to have a great impact. Moreover, the GPT model seems to outperform the NMT systems but performs poorly for Irish. The study aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of online MT systems in handling context and highlight the importance of considering contextual factors in evaluating MT systems.},

The amplification of biases in language technology has mainly been examined with respect to specific phenomena, such as gender bias. In this work, we go beyond the study of gender in MT and investigate how bias amplification might affect language in a broader sense. We hypothesize that the `algorithmic bias', i.e. an exacerbation of frequently observed patterns in combination with a loss of less frequent ones, not only exacerbates societal biases present in current datasets but could also lead to an artificially impoverished language: `machine translationese'. We assess the linguistic richness (on a lexical and morphological level) of translations created by different data-driven MT paradigms – phrase-based statistical (PB-SMT) and neural MT (NMT). Our experiments show that there is a loss of lexical and syntactic richness in the translations produced by all investigated MT paradigms for two language pairs (EN-FR and EN-ES).},

Our work differs in that we use state-of-the-art pre-trained LMs, as well as the test sets of the WMT news shared tasks as training data, to ensure the sentences were not seen during training of the MT system itself. Moreover, we analyse performance for a number of different experimental setups, such as adding translationese data, going beyond the sentence-level and normalizing punctuation. We show that (i) choosing a state-of-the-art LM can make quite a difference: our best baseline system (DeBERTa) outperforms both BERT and RoBERTa by over 3\% accuracy, (ii) adding translationese data is only beneficial if there is not much data available, (iii) considerable improvements can be obtained by classifying at the document-level and (iv) normalizing punctuation and thus avoiding (some) shortcuts has no impact on model performance.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the distinctive features of translated and interpreted texts in specific language combinations as forms of mediated discourse at the European Parliament. We aim to contribute to the long line of research on the specific properties of translation/interpreting. Specifically, we are interested in mediation effects (translation vs. interpreting) vs. effects of discourse mode (written vs. spoken). We propose a data-driven, exploratory approach to detecting and evaluating linguistic features as typical of translation/interpreting. Our approach utilizes simple wordbased n-gram language models combined with the information-theoretic measure of relative entropy, a standard measure of similarity/difference between probability distributions, applied here as a method of corpus comparison. Comparing translation and interpreting (including the relation to their originals), we confirm the previously observed overall trend of written vs. spoken mode being strongly reflected in the translation and interpreting output. In addition, we detect some new features, such as a tendency towards more general lexemes in the verbal domain in interpreting or features of nominal style in translation.},

	abstract = {The present paper deals with a computational analysis of translationese in professional and student English-to-German translations belonging to different registers. Building upon an information-theoretical approach, we test translation conformity to source and target language in terms of a neural language model's perplexity over Part of Speech (PoS) sequences. Our primary focus is on register diversification vs. convergence, reflected in the use of constructions eliciting a higher vs. lower perplexity score. Our results show that, against our expectations, professional translations elicit higher perplexity scores from a target language model than students' translations. An analysis of the distribution of PoS patterns across registers shows that this apparent paradox is the effect of higher stylistic diversification and register sensitivity in professional translations. Our results contribute to the understanding of human translationese and shed light on the variation in texts generated by different translators, which is valuable for translation studies, multilingual language processing, and machine translation.},

	abstract = {While the benefits of using post-editing for technical texts have been more or less acknowledged, it remains unclear whether post-editing is a viable alternative to human translation for more general text types. In addition, we need a better understanding of both translation methods and how they are performed by students as well as professionals, so that pitfalls can be determined and translator training can be adapted accordingly. In this article, we aim to get a better understanding of the differences between human translation and post-editing for newspaper articles. Processes are registered by means of eye tracking and keystroke logging, which allows us to study translation speed, cognitive load, and the use of external resources. We also look at the final quality of the product as well as translators’ attitude towards both methods of translation. Studying these different aspects shows that both methods and groups are more similar than anticipated. , Bien que l’on ait une certaine connaissance des avantages de la post-édition pour les textes techniques, il reste difficile de savoir si celle-ci est une solution de remplacement viable à la traduction humaine pour les textes généraux. Il faut par ailleurs comprendre davantage les deux méthodes de traduction, et la façon dont elles sont appliquées par les étudiants et les traducteurs professionnels, pour en déterminer les écueils et adapter la formation des traducteurs en conséquence. Dans cet article, nous cherchons à mieux cerner les différences entre la traduction humaine et la post-édition pour les articles de journaux. L’oculométrie et l’enregistrement de frappes ont été utilisés pour étudier le processus de traduction et dégager les gains en productivité, la charge cognitive et l’utilisation de ressources externes. Nous avons également examiné la qualité de la traduction et l’attitude des traducteurs à l’égard des deux méthodes de traduction. L’étude de ces différentes perspectives met en évidence que les deux groupes de traducteurs comme les deux méthodes de traduction sont plus proches que ce que l’on pouvait présumer. , Mientras que se reconocen cada vez más los beneficios del uso de la post-edición para la traducción de textos técnicos, aún no existen pruebas de que la post-edición sea una alternativa viable a la traducción humana para los textos más generales. Además, necesitamos una mejor comprensión de ambos métodos de traducción, así como de la forma en que son realizados por estudiantes y por profesionales, para que se puedan definir los posibles obstáculos y adaptar la formación de los traductores en función de ellos. En este artículo, nuestro objetivo es lograr una mejor comprensión de las diferencias entre la traducción humana y la post-edición de artículos periodísticos. Los procesos de traducción se registran mediante el seguimiento ocular y el registro de pulsaciones de teclas, lo que nos permite estudiar la velocidad de traducción, la carga cognitiva y el uso de recursos externos. También analizamos la calidad final del producto, así como la actitud de los traductores hacia ambos métodos de traducción. El estudio de estos diferentes aspectos demuestra que tanto los métodos como los grupos de traductores son más similares de lo previsto.},

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5\${\textbackslash}times\$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.},

In recent research, we have started investigating such socio-technical factors from an ergonomic perspective. Observations at professional workplaces, responses to questionnaires, and in-depth interviews with translators suggest that their perceived self-determination is more important to the success of socio-technical change than the technological developments themselves. A lack of involvement in decision-making at the workflow level may explain why so many translators have been resistant to taking new technology on board. We discuss how a feedback culture could mitigate many socio-technical issues by giving translators a voice in change and empowering them to contribute to organizational learning and growth.},

Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts revealed key themes related to the use of Online Language Learning Tools (OLLTs) and MTTs, students' uncertainty about MTT functionalities, policies regarding MTT use, and suggestions for MTT training. The findings highlight the significant impact of initial encounters with MTTs on learners' long-term perceptions and use of these tools. Participants demonstrated strategic use of MTTs to support their reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills, while being aware of their limitations. Although learners found MTTs helpful, they also emphasised the importance of authentic communication in language learning.

            The new paradigm of neural machine translation is leading to profound changes in the translation industry. Surprisingly good results have led to high expectations; however, there are substantial risks that have not yet been sufficiently taken into account. Risks exist on three levels: first, what kind of damage can clients and end users incur in safety-critical domains if the NMT result contains errors; second, who is liable for damage caused by the use of NMT; third, what cyber risks can the use of NMT entail, especially when free online engines are used. When establishing sustainable measures to reduce such risks, we also need to consider general principles of human behaviour if we want to make sure that all agents comply with provisions and requirements.},

            University students, especially language learners, have increasingly been using machine translation (MT) systems in the last decade and for all kinds of texts, including homework, assignments and exams. This ubiquity does not translate into visibility as few teachers address the subject in class. Several researchers have shown that MT systems, while technically very easy to access and use, are not always employed in a critical manner. They have therefore suggested that users should develop MT literacy skills. As part of a larger Swiss project on digital literacy in university contexts (DigLit), an action research project at the University of Neuchâtel Language Centre (UniNE LC) seeks to investigate whether delivering a 20-min presentation about machine translation in all L2 classes (French, German, English) at the beginning of the semester was sufficient to foster minimal MT literacy in language learners. All LC students were surveyed at the end of the semester. These survey results were compared with those from a survey of Swiss university students carried out in spring 2021 as part of the DigLit project. These results have allowed us to monitor and enhance the teaching of MT literacy skills in our LC.},

When analysing users’ metalinguistic awareness, we discovered that non-translators perceive the text to translate, mostly at word level, leading to the misuse of MT systems as ODs. Moreover, the survey results revealed confusion between the different digital tools for language learning, namely MT, online parallel corpora like Linguee and ODs.

	abstract = {Nowadays, hardly anyone working in the field of foreign language teaching and learning can imagine life without machine translation (MT) tools. Thanks to the rapid development of artificial intelligence, MT now most widely assumes a new form, the so-called Neural Machine Translation (NMT), which offers the potential for a wide application in foreign language learning (FLL). Therefore, the purpose of this review study is to explore different approaches to the efficient implementation of NMT into FLL and provide specific pedagogical implications for best practices. The PRISMA methodology for systematic reviews and meta-analyses was strictly followed. The search was conducted in two well-established databases, specifically Scopus and Web of Science, to generate sufficient data from research articles for further analysis. The findings of this systematic review indicate that NMT is an efficient tool for developing both productive (speaking and writing) and receptive (reading and listening) language skills, including mediation skills, which are relevant for translation. Moreover, the results show that NMT tools are especially suitable for advanced learners of L2, whose higher proficiency level enables them to critically reflect on the output of NMT texts more than beginners or lower-intermediate learners. Thus, the findings of this review study reveal that NMT has valuable implications for L2 pedagogy since it can serve as a very powerful online reference tool for FLL provided that teachers introduce students to its benefits but also limitations by implementing various teaching approaches.},

After discussing the high relevance of machine trans-lation literacy and data literacy in professional translation contexts, the paper introduces the DataLitMT project and discusses a framework of professional MT literacy and an MT-oriented data literacy framework, which form the two theoretical pillars of the project. Also, the interface between MT literacy and data literacy will be illustrated by showing how specific (sub)dimensions of data literacy can be mapped to relevant (sub)dimensions of professional MT literacy. Finally, the paper presents some preliminary didactic resources of the DataLitMT project – concerned with social biases in MT, with MT training data preparation and with automatic MT quality evaluation – and discusses how these resources can be used to teach specific (sub)dimensions of data literacy and professional MT literacy to students in the fields of translation/specialised communication studies.

Syllabus design, models for competence development, methodologies and evaluation procedures in this area have benefited from advances in translation pedagogy, but findings relating to the teaching of MT have been slow to be implemented in the translation classroom. Numerous studies have reflected translators’ perspectives on MT, including those of professional associations, employers, and institutional organizations. Students’ perspectives have also been collected, but the voice of the translation instructors is yet to be heard. A number of  questions arise: What do translator educators think of MT? Would they be willing to use it in the translation classroom? If so, how and to what purpose? To answer  these and related questions, we present the results of a qualitative study conducted with a group of translation educators at Universitat de València (University of Valencia, Spain) in the context of a broader research project. We specifically investigated their beliefs and perspectives towards the introduction of MT into the translation classroom. We used open-ended questions to collect qualitative data, and subsequently analysed responses within the framework of Grounded Theory. Findings provide valuable insights for discussion on the following topics: MT literacy, the blurring of MT key concepts and categorizations, the effect of MT on the development of translation competences, agency in MT reaching a stage where there is no longer a place for the human translator, and the eventual eclipse of the translator.},

Over the past few years, these tools have become increasingly popular, a development that has given rise to questions about their benefits for foreign language learning and teaching. A total of 1187 participants (985 students and 202 teachers) took part in the study. They came from primary schools, lower and upper secondary schools (Gymnasium and Fachmatura, vocational schools), as well as tertiary education and professional development classes. The survey was conducted in French (n=834) and German (n=353) in the cantons of Bern, Fribourg, Geneva, Jura, Neuchâtel and Solothurn. Participation was voluntary. Results show that regardless of language background and educational context, participants perceive of the tools as a normal and largely established part of their everyday practices. Compared to their teachers, students are more optimistic about the tools’ potential contribution to foreign language learning and less concerned about possible pitfalls linked to using the tools. Students in lower secondary school use digital translation aids less frequently and rate their contribution to language learning and motivation less favourably than the other learner groups. Many teachers would like to use digital translators and online dictionaries in their classroom, but they express uncertainty about how to do so meaningfully. Teachers voice concerns over certain student practices, namely the lack of cognitive involvement when simply translating text without considering the output. Teachers also highlight the gap between curricular/institutional prescriptions and the way the tools are commonly used, a mismatch that can affect their teaching. Overall, our findings emphasize the need for a) empirical evidence on the effects of digital translation tools on foreign language acquisition, b) pedagogical scenarios for implementing the tools, and 3) alignment of policy with practice.},

This article examines user conceptualisations of privacy and their implications for the understanding of human-MT interaction. It draws on the privacy literature, on an online forum and on a survey of MT users. The findings show that while users have concerns about sharing information such as passwords, images, and contact details with MT providers, some of them can conversely see MT as a technology that provides privacy. The article discusses these findings in relation to the informational and relational dimensions of privacy. It argues that relational privacy, and the interpersonal exchanges for which MT can be used as a substitute, should be considered more explicitly in discussions of the societal implications of MT technology.},

            Machine translation (MT) tools like Google Translate can overcome language barriers and increase access to information. These tools also carry risks, and their societal role remains understudied. This article investigates typical uses and perceptions of MT based on a survey of 1200 United Kingdom residents who were representative of the national population in terms of age, sex, and ethnicity. We highlight three main findings from our analysis. First, participants often used MT for non-essential purposes that rarely justified professional human translations. Second, while they were highly satisfied with MT they also expressed desires for higher MT quality. These desires were usually motivated by expectations of perfection rather than fitness for purpose. Third, participants’ future vision for MT involved increasingly blurred boundaries between text and speech. The article calls for more MT research on the interface between written and spoken communication and on the ethical implications of rare but significant high-risk uses of the technology.},

This study draws on the news framing literature to present an analysis of how MT is described in the written press. Based on a sample of 284 MT-focused newspaper articles, the news reporting on MT was found to be significantly more positive than negative. This positive framing was unrelated to the launch of neural MT. Furthermore, the portrayal of MT in the press tended to lack nuance, with few instances that raised awareness of the technology’s use implications. The study calls for higher standards in the public discussion and promotion of MT and for more research on non-professional conceptualisations of translation technologies and their role in communication.},

            MT literacy means knowing how MT works, how the technology can be useful in a particular context, and what the implications are of using it for various purposes. As MT usage grows, the necessity for MT literacy also grows. This knowledge forms part of the greater need for digital literacies. In this contribution, we relate MT literacy to the concept of cognitive load in professional translation production and in translator training scenarios. We then move beyond the sphere of translation studies to examine other use-case settings—crisis communication, academic writing and patent publishing—to consider how MT can offer solutions and how MT literacy can impact cognitively in those settings. We discuss how training in MT literacy can empower language professionals and present two proposals for course content designed for MT users in other sectors.},

            The data-driven paradigm of neural machine translation is a powerful translation technology based on state-of-the art approaches in artificial intelligence research. This technology is employed extensively in the professional translation process, requiring an adequate degree of machine translation literacy on the part of professional translators. At the same time, the increasing datafication to be observed in modern society – both in private as well as in professional contexts – contributes to the rise in prominence of another digital literacy, i. e., data literacy, which is also of high relevance with regard to data-driven machine translation. The present paper analyses and discusses in detail the individual dimensions and subdimensions of professional machine translation literacy and data literacy and attempts to integrate the two concepts. It thereby lays the theoretical foundation for a didactic project concerned with teaching data literacy in its machine translation-specific form to students in the fields of translation and specialised communication studies.},

After a brief introduction in which the relevance of AI literacy in the language industry is highlighted, the article provides a concise overview of artificial neural networks and a brief history of neural network-based artificial intelligence. This is intended to lay the conceptual groundwork for the subsequent discussion of the basic principles and capabilities of large language models. Then, the article investigates in detail the concept of AI literacy, discussing the AI Literacy Framework proposed by Long/Magerko (2020) and illustrating the interface between AI literacy and the two adjacent digital literacies of professional machine translation literacy and data literacy. The article then zooms in on the practical applicability of AI technologies by discussing areas where workflows in the language industry (with a focus on the computer-assisted translation process) could be automated or optimised through large language models. The article concludes with some general reflections on the relevance of field-specific and societal AI literacy in the presence of powerful AI technologies.},

            The author reports on the findings of a survey among conference interpreters regarding their readiness for and

                    sample of 496 conference interpreters, most of them members of AIIC. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with
                    25 of them to gain deeper insights into their attitudes towards AI-enabled tools and the potential impact on their professional
                    practice. The results indicate a cautious openness towards technology balanced by concerns about cognitive load, ethical issues
                    and the impact on traditional skills. The findings suggest the need for comprehensive training to enhance technological skills

The aim was to verify how such tools can be integrated in the curriculum by identifying potential issues and suggesting solutions. We ran an experiment with 12 MA interpreting students to observe their behaviour during the simultaneous interpreting of terminology-dense texts. Experience seems to play a key role in helping students integrate the tool in their workflow in the booth. Some students, however, tend to excessively rely on the software program, while others see it as a source of distraction and find it hard to focus on the delivery.

	abstract = {Abstract Aims and objectives To understand the attitudes and perceptions of older people with limited English proficiency (LEP) and healthcare workers to using mobile translation technology for overcoming language barriers in the healthcare setting. Background Australia's cohort of people aged 65 and over has a sizeable population with LEP. In healthcare settings, difficulties with communication may potentially result in inadequate care. Mobile language translation applications have been identified as a potential way to improve communication between patients and healthcare staff when used as an adjunct to professional interpreters in low‐risk scenarios; however, the perceptions of the use of mobile translation applications for such communication is unknown. Methods A multi‐method design was used. Focus group discussions were conducted with older people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds and nursing and allied health professionals to understand their perceptions of translation technology. Qualitative data were analysed using inductive content analysis. Qualitative findings were reported using the Standards for Reporting of Qualitative Research (SRQR) checklist. Participants also appraised three existing translation apps via survey and results were analysed using descriptive statistics. Results Overall, older people from CALD backgrounds ( n  = 12) and healthcare staff ( n  = 17) agreed that translation technology could play a role in reducing communication barriers. There was enthusiasm amongst older people to learn and use the technology, while healthcare staff saw the potential to address communication barriers in their own work. Barriers identified by older people and healthcare staff included: accuracy of translation and phrases, possible technological learning curves, risk of mistranslation in high‐risk conversation and inability to check accuracy of translation. Fixed‐phrase translation apps were seen as more favourable than real‐time voice‐to‐voice mobile translation applications. Conclusions Older people from CALD backgrounds and healthcare staff were open to the use of mobile translation applications for everyday healthcare communications. Relevance to clinical practice Translation applications may have a role in reducing language barriers in everyday healthcare communication but context, accuracy and ease of use need to be considered.},

In this paper, using bibliographical and documental research, we briefly analyse the tools cited by several authors to identify which ones remain up to date and available on the market. Following that, we present concepts about automation, and observe the usage of automatic speech recognition (ASR), while analysing its potential benefits and the current level of maturity of such an approach, especially regarding Computer-Assisted Interpreting (CAI) tools.

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years, affecting multiple aspects of life. In particular, this has had an impact on the machine translation of texts, reducing or removing human interaction. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based translation software models have thus become widely available, and these now include Google Translate, Bing, Microsoft Translator, DeepL, Reverso, Systran Translate, and Amazon Translate. Several computer-aided translation (CAT) tools such as Memoq, Trados, Smartcat, Lokalise, Smartling, Crowdin, TextUnited, and Memsource are also available. More recently, artificial intelligence has been applied in the development of applications such as ChatGPT, ChatSonic, GPT-3 Playground, Chat GPT 4 and YouChat, which simulate conversational responses to researchers’ inquiries, mimicking human interactions more directly. This study thus aimed to examine any remaining contrasts between human and AI translation in the legal field to investigate the potential hypothesis that there is now no difference between human and AI translation. The paper thus also examined concerns about whether the need for human translators will decline in the face of AI development, as well as beginning to assess whether it will ever be possible for those in the legal field to depend only on machine translation. To achieve this, a collection of legal texts from various contracts was chosen, and these pieces were both allocated to legal translators and subjected to AI translation systems. Using a contrastive methodology, the study thus examined the differences between AI and human translation, examining the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches and discussing the sit­ uations in which each approach might be most effective.},

We find that clinicians face challenges stemming from lack of time and resources, cultural barriers, and medical literacy rates, as well as accountability in cases of miscommunication. Clinicians have devised strategies to aid communication in the face of language barriers including back translation, non-verbal communication, and testing patient understanding. We propose design implications for machine translation systems including combining neural MT with pre-translated medical phrases, integrating translation support with multimodal communication, and providing interactive support for testing mutual understanding.},

Drawing on an HMC framework, we outline a research agenda built around three key aspects of communicative AI technologies: (1) the functional dimensions through which people make sense of these devices and applications as communicators, (2) the relational dynamics through which people associate with these technologies and, in turn, relate to themselves and others, and (3) the metaphysical implications called up by blurring ontological boundaries surrounding what constitutes human, machine, and communication.},

The results show that interpreters can cope with a system latency of 3 seconds without any major impact in the rendition of the original text, both in terms of accuracy and fluency. This value is above the typical latency of available AI-based CAI tools and paves the way to experiment with larger context-based language models and higher latencies.},

	abstract = {Preparation has been proposed in the literature as one of the most important phases of an interpreting assignment, especially if the subject is highly specialised. Preparing an assignment in advance aims at bridging the linguistic and extra-linguistic gap between conference participants and interpreters and at reducing the cognitive load during interpretation. For these reasons it is considered crucial in ensuring higher interpreting quality. Yet, preparation is generally time-consuming and interpreters may often experience the feeling of not knowing exactly how to perform this task efficiently. Information technology could change this. Even though the first computer-assisted interpreting software has entered the profession in recent years, no tool has been specifically developed to satisfy the needs of interpreters during the preparatory phase. After analysing different theoretical frameworks of interpreting preparation, this paper aims at presenting a tool that implements a corpus-driven approach to preparation. According to this approach, the process of knowledge and language acquisition needed to perform well as an interpreter is optimized by making it corpus-driven: browsing the terminology of the domain in a specialised corpus, interpreters are able to reconstruct its conceptual structure, prepare subject-related glossaries and rationalise the preparatory work.},

Fortunately, there are an ever-growing number of applications capable of assisting interpreters before and during an interpretation service, even though they are still few compared to those devoted to translators.

We interviewed 10 Chinese-English interpreters, to find out about their preparation for such conferences and their approach to developing domain-specific knowledge. We first collected each interpreter’s five latest conference programs and used these to analyze the knowledge domains covered. We then based each interview on one conference agenda, considered representative by the interpreter, to examine the knowledge acquisition process from pre- to post-conference. The results show strategic preparation of unfamiliar topics: to facilitate comprehension and reformulation, interpreters make good use of conference documents and compile glossaries in which they organize the concepts and terminology specific to the conference. As they assimilate the language usage of the presenters and other participants during the conference, they use their analytical skills to manage any difficulties. Keeping in mind the aims of the event (e.g., commercial, scientific), as well as the profiles of the speakers and target audience, helps to optimize availability of relevant knowledge at short notice and continue updating it during the assignment.},

Productivity results also suggest that IPE may be an interesting alternative to TPE, given the fact that translators worked faster in IPE even though they had no experience in this new machine translation post-editing modality, but were already used to TPE.},

Our online experiment ( N = 284) compares people’s perceptions of MT and human translation in an ethically charged situation, in which the translation serves an immigrant worker in an interaction defined by power imbalance. Using hierarchical linear regression, we found that an otherwise identical translation was evaluated differently when it was attributed to MT or human translation. Results reveal that translators and non-translators alike exhibit a negative bias toward the MT product when asked to assess its accuracy and reliability, its ability to convey cultural and emotional otherness, and its potential effectiveness in helping the disadvantaged immigrant in need of the translation. We also demonstrate how lower evaluations of the MT product lead to a stronger wish to intervene in the translation by introducing changes to the original message. Our results suggest that predispositions toward MT must be taken into account in any consideration of MT-mediated communication, as these predispositions may shape the communicative act itself.},

In order to define the basis on which this application should be designed, this study, which is part of a larger one focused on analysing the way in which prior preparation and glossary elaboration are approached at different educational and professional levels, aims to respond to three objectives: identifying the nature of the main drawbacks encountered by interpreters when preparing for an assignment; identifying the factors that interpreters recognise as determining in increasing the degree of their preparation; and, finally, identifying the interpreters’ future prospects in terms of prior preparation. To this end, a questionnaire was developed aimed at working professional interpreters, to which 41 subjects have responded so far. The preliminary data collected will allow us to initially define the guidelines that will mark the development of the application that aims to combine the linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge acquired by the interpreter for each new assignment in order to guarantee the most effective contextualisation of the speaker’s words and, consequently, achieve the greatest degree of success.},

Twenty-two interpreting students on a one-year MA course in the UK were divided into a test group (10 students) and a control group (12 students). Nine days before the experiment, which involved SI from the A into the B language as well as vice versa, both groups were given preparatory documentation in both languages. In addition, the test group received term lists automatically generated by the extraction tool and used the Sketch Engine concordance tool. The control group extracted terms manually and did not have the concordance tool. Terminological accuracy in SI was found to be significantly higher, with fewer omissions, even when terms occurred in rapid succession, in the test group. All students afterwards participated in focus group discussions, providing feedback on the effectiveness of their preparation and an estimate of the time they had dedicated to it.

After a review of the development and state of the art in machine interpreting, more commonly referred to as ‘spoken language translation’ or ‘speech translation’, the question of whether machine interpreting is interpreting is discussed – first with regard to terminology and conceptual distinctions and then in broader translation-theoretical frameworks. Using Otto Kade’s early definitional proposal as a point of departure, a reconceptualization is proposed in the form of a three-dimensional model designed to go beyond rigid taxonomies. The dimensions of agency, embodiment and immediacy are used to characterize translation as a graded concept in which these features may be more or less prominent.},

	abstract = {Abstract The volume of Audiovisual Translation (AVT) is increasing to meet the rising demand for data that needs to be accessible around the world. Machine Translation (MT) is one of the most innovative technologies to be deployed in the field of translation, but it is still too early to predict how it can support the creativity and productivity of professional translators in the future. Currently, MT is more widely used in (non-AV) text translation than in AVT. In this article, we discuss MT technology and demonstrate why its use in AVT scenarios is particularly challenging. We also present some potentially useful methods and tools for measuring MT quality that have been developed primarily for text translation. The ultimate objective is to bridge the gap between the tech-savvy AVT community, on the one hand, and researchers and developers in the field of high-quality MT, on the other.},

The task of identifying and fixing these errors is called post-editing (PE). In this chapter, I provide an overview of the PE process, drawing on both academic and industry sources. I explain how PE is generally divided into light and full PE, and describe standard guidelines for each type, homing in on issues that arise in the application of this classification. The chapter also surveys the various types of interface used in PE (including word processing and spreadsheet software, and professional computer-aided translation tools), and modes of interaction (traditional, adaptive or interactive). Finally, concepts and tools used by researchers into PE are described, and particular focus is put on the measurement of temporal, technical and cognitive effort.},

	volume = {42},
		doi = {10.26034/cm.jostrans.2024.5989},
	abstract = {Poland, historically known as a stronghold of voice-over when it comes to audiovisual translation (AVT), as evidenced by opinion polls of the 1990s and early 2000s, underwent a substantial shift in its AVT landscape with the emergence of streaming services. This paradigm shift not only grants viewers the autonomy to choose what and when to watch, but also enables them to select their preferred AVT type, with many opting against voice-over. This study aims to provide empirical evidence confirming these evolving AVT preferences of Polish viewers. Conducting an online survey of nearly 1300 adult Poles, we explore their AVT preferences and viewing habits across cinemas, television, and streaming platforms. Additionally, we investigate potential genre-related variations in AVT preferences, specifically comparing preferences for dubbing in animation versus live-action content. Our findings show a departure from the traditional preference towards voice-over towards subtitling, particularly prominent among millennials and Generation Z. Young Polish viewers are also increasingly drawn to VOD platforms and away from traditional linear TV broadcasts. Many viewers also express a notable fondness for dubbing in animated productions, especially those nostalgically remembered from childhood.},

We then conduct a modified eval- uation taking these issues into account. Our results indicate that all the claims of human parity and super-human perfor- mance made at WMT2019 should be re- futed, except the claim of human parity for English→German. Based on our findings, we put forward a set of recommendations and open questions for future assessments of human parity in machine translation.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter provides a brief history of machine translation (MT). Machine translation is not primarily an area of abstract intellectual inquiry but the application of computer and language sciences to the development of systems answering practical needs. The term “machine translation” (MT) refers to computerized systems responsible for the production of translations with or without human assistance. It excludes computer-based translation tools that support translators by providing access to on-line dictionaries, remote terminology databanks, transmission and reception of texts, etc. The second basic design strategy is the Interlingua approach that assumes that it is possible to convert SL texts into semantico-syntactic representations common to more than one language. The third basic strategy is the less ambitious transfer approach. Rather than operating in two stages through a single interlingual representation, there are three stages involving underlying (abstract) representations for both SL and TL texts. The use of mechanical dictionaries to overcome the barriers of language was first suggested in the 17th century.},

We analyse the quality of the generated texts based on different criteria, such as correctness, readability, and syntactic complexity. The results indicated that the generated texts are easier than the standard texts, but that they still do not fully meet the established Easy Language standards.

	abstract = {Language learning and translation have always been complementary pillars of multilingualism in the European Union. Both have been affected by the increasing availability of machine translation (MT): language learners now make use of free online MT to help them both understand and produce texts in a second language, but there are fears that uninformed use of the technology could undermine effective language learning. At the same time, MT is promoted as a technology that will change the face of professional translation, but the technical opacity of contemporary approaches, and the legal and ethical issues they raise, can make the participation of human translators in contemporary MT workflows particularly complicated. Against this background, this book attempts to promote teaching and learning about MT among a broad range of readers, including language learners, language teachers, trainee translators, translation teachers, and professional translators. It presents a rationale for learning about MT, and provides both a basic introduction to contemporary machine-learning based MT, and a more advanced discussion of neural MT. It explores the ethical issues that increased use of MT raises, and provides advice on its application in language learning. It also shows how users can make the most of MT through pre-editing, post-editing and customization of the technology.},

            Human evaluation of modern high-quality machine translation systems is a difficult problem, and there is increasing evidence that inadequate evaluation procedures can lead to erroneous conclusions. While there has been considerable research on human evaluation, the field still lacks a commonly accepted standard procedure. As a step toward this goal, we propose an evaluation methodology grounded in explicit error analysis, based on the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework. We carry out the largest MQM research study to date, scoring the outputs of top systems from the WMT 2020 shared task in two language pairs using annotations provided by professional translators with access to full document context. We analyze the resulting data extensively, finding among other results a substantially different ranking of evaluated systems from the one established by the WMT crowd workers, exhibiting a clear preference for human over machine output. Surprisingly, we also find that automatic metrics based on pre-trained embeddings can outperform human crowd workers. We make our corpus publicly available for further research.},

Millions of people are using it today in online translation systems and mobile applications in order to communicate across language barriers. The question naturally arises whether such systems can approach or achieve parity with human translations. In this paper, we first address the problem of how to define and accurately measure human parity in translation. We then describe Microsoft's machine translation system and measure the quality of its translations on the widely used WMT 2017 news translation task from Chinese to English. We find that our latest neural machine translation system has reached a new state-of-the-art, and that the translation quality is at human parity when compared to professional human translations. We also find that it significantly exceeds the quality of crowd-sourced non-professional translations.},

Comparing to results from WMT22's Metrics shared task, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in both modes when compared to MQM-based human labels. Our results are valid on the system level for all three WMT22 Metrics shared task language pairs, namely English into German, English into Russian, and Chinese into English. This provides a first glimpse into the usefulness of pre-trained, generative large language models for quality assessment of translations. We publicly release all our code and prompt templates used for the experiments described in this work, as well as all corresponding scoring results, to allow for external validation and reproducibility.},

These models are ensembled together using a hyper-parameter search that weights different features extracted from both evaluation models and combines them into a single score. For the reference-free evaluation, we present CometKiwi. Similarly to our primary submission, CometKiwi is an ensemble between two models.

While NMT has achieved a huge quality improvement in comparison to conventional methodologies, by taking advantage of a huge amount of parallel corpora available from the internet and the recently developed super computational power support with an acceptable cost, it struggles to achieve real human parity in many domains and most language pairs, if not all of them. Alongside the long road of MT research and development, quality evaluation metrics played very important roles in MT advancement and evolution. In this tutorial, we overview the traditional human judgement criteria, automatic evaluation metrics, unsupervised quality estimation models, as well as the meta-evaluation of the evaluation methods. Among these, we will also cover the very recent work in the MT evaluation (MTE) fields, taking advantage of the large size of pre-trained language models for automatic metric customisation towards exactly deployed language pairs and domains. In addition, we also introduce the statistical confidence estimation regarding the sample size needed for human evaluation in real practice simulation.

	abstract = {Machine translation (MT) is directly linked to its evaluation in order to both compare different MT system outputs and analyse system errors so that they can be addressed and corrected. As a consequence, MT evaluation has become increasingly important and popular in the last decade, leading to the development of MT evaluation metrics aiming at automatically assessing MT output. Most of these metrics use reference translations in order to compare system output, and the most well-known and widely spread work at lexical level. In this study we describe and present a linguistically-motivated metric, VERTa, which aims at using and combining a wide variety of linguistic features at lexical, morphological, syntactic and semantic level. Before designing and developing VERTa a qualitative linguistic analysis of data was performed so as to identify the linguistic phenomena that an MT metric must consider (Comelles et al. 2017). In the present study we introduce VERTa’s design and architecture and we report the experiments performed in order to develop the metric and to check the suitability and interaction of the linguistic information used. The experiments carried out go beyond traditional correlation scores and step towards a more qualitative approach based on linguistic analysis. Finally, in order to check the validity of the metric, an evaluation has been conducted comparing the metric’s performance to that of other well-known state-of-the-art MT metrics.},

	abstract = {In some translations, the source text influences the syntactic structures or the lexis of the target text (shining-through), while other translations contain fewer traces of  language transfer than original texts in the target language (normalization). On the lexical level, this can be seen in the number of cognates. There is no definite answer to the question of how these phenomena can be linked to mental processes yet. However, psycholinguistic literature shows that the shining-through effect can be explained by the structure of the mental lexicon as well as the mechanisms for accessing words: the cognate-facilitation-effect. The aim of this study is to provide an explanation for normalization. The hypothesis was that verbal self-monitoring, after the first activation of words but before articulation, filters out cognates. For this purpose, written and oral translations were compared. Written translations, which are monitored more strongly, contained fewer cognates than oral translations. Accordingly, the interpretation of this study was that self-monitoring filters out cognates before the translator starts writing and that it is therefore an important factor for normalization.},

One purpose is to test the use of sequences of part-of-speech tags as a search method for contrastive studies. The other is to investigate the functions and meanings of prepositional phrases in the position after a noun across the two languages. The comparison of original texts shows that the function of postmodifier is most frequent in both languages, with adverbial in second place. Other functions are rare. English has more postmodifiers and fewer adverbials than Norwegian. Furthermore, the prepositional phrases express locative meaning, in both functions, more frequently in Norwegian than in English. The study of translations reveals that the adverbials have congruent correspondences more often than postmodifiers, particularly in translations from English into Norwegian.},

            This article discusses the challenges that the rendering of the pragmatic implications of texts into a target
					language posed for human translators and, by extension, for automated translation. It starts by discussing the importance of
					pragmatics, focusing on two concepts that have received much attention on the part of pragmaticians as well as translation
					scholars, namely implicatures and politeness. It moves to on to present some of the most notable publications on the interface
					between pragmatics and machine translation. These illustrate that the interest in the pragmatic value of language has not
					succeeded in advancing the integration of pragmatics into automated translation. Drawing on Kesckes and House, the last section
					discusses two concepts to be considered regarding the role of pragmatics in intercultural mediation.},

            International NGOs (INGOs) are important agents in delivering the UN’s sustainable development agenda, but their linguistic practices have received little attention in the field of language policy and planning. This article aims to add new insights to the field by exploring the link between INGOs’ organisational value of inclusiveness and their institutional approaches to translation. It does so through a case study of Oxfam GB’s and Tearfund’s translation policy documents. The analysis reveals that the policy documents focus on written translation into a handful of lingua francas. In other words, they largely overlook the need for interpreting and translation from and into local languages. In addition, the policy documents do not make any overt links between principles of (linguistic) inclusiveness and the need for translation. The article summarises the advantages and drawbacks of creating a translation policy, and provides guidance on linking translation policy more overtly to values of inclusiveness.},

            Having a central scientific language remains crucial for advancing and globally sharing science. Nevertheless, maintaining one dominant language also creates barriers to accessing scientific careers and knowledge. From an interdisciplinary perspective, we describe how, when, and why to make scientific literature more readily available in multiple languages through the practice of translation. We broadly review the advantages and limitations of neural machine translation systems and propose that translation can serve as both a short- and a long-term solution for making science more resilient, accessible, globally representative, and impactful beyond the academy. We outline actions that individuals and institutions can take to support multilingual science and scientists, including structural changes that encourage and value translating scientific literature. In the long term, improvements to machine translation technologies and collective efforts to change academic norms can transform a monolingual scientific hub into a multilingual scientific network. Translations are available in the supplemental material.},

It investigates what happens to metaphor in scientific discourse when translated into another language, on both micro- and macro-levels. Since one of the main advantages of a data-rich multilingual study of this kind is that it can potentially produce results that allow us to draw conclusions about this aspect of scientific translation at a high level of gener- alization, particular attention is paid to tendencies that appear to be common to translators regardless of the target language. The study distinguishes between macro-level mappings and micro-level metaphorical expressions and examines individual mappings and clusters of mappings in the English source text and their renderings into all five languages. It adopts a bottom-up approach, in that all mappings and other high-level structures are posited on the basis of the metaphorical expressions identified rather than trying to fit the metaphorical expressions into a pre-determined framework of categories.},

In my contribution, I want to focus on a less known aspect: the translation policy. From 1790 on, several decrees stipulated the translation of national laws and decrees into the regional languages in France. From the mid-1790s on, the translation policy was extended to other countries and regions under French rule. I will consider the case of the Southern Netherlands (Belgium), annexed by France in October 1795 and under French administration until the end of the Napoleonic era. According to the opinio communis, the period under consideration was strictly monolingual in France and Belgium, with French as the only language of administration and justice. I will argue that there was a covert multilingualism, that today is often ignored.},

Following the question "what happens when sociologists translate sociology", the paper explores the development of Weber's field of translation over time and puts the structure of the field in context with the translation strategies chosen by three different translators following Andrew Chesterman's categories. It is shown that Weber's growing recognition in the field of social studies has considerably contributed to changing the strategies chosen when translating Weber. References to Parson's translation, detailed discussions of terminology, introductions and other paratextual elements in more recent translation are not only evidence of dynamics internal to the translation field, but also show the importance for the translators/sociologists to be visible to their readers and to offer a text accessible to a modern public.},

            Language policy is a hugely diverse field, united only by the intent to influence language use in some way. Much early research in the field asserted that language policy had an emancipatory drive, to empower downtrodden minorities against the cruelty or indifference of majoritarian politics. But over the years, critical accounts have increasingly questioned who precisely benefits from promoting minoritized languages. Indeed, can the language itself, valorized as an emblem of heritage, sometimes become invested with its own separate value? Can that value even outweigh concerns over improving people's prospects and capabilities? In what follows, I compare that balance between people's capabilities and the language itself, across a range of cases. I show especially how a growing focus on “new speakers” affects that balance.

            Abstract 
            Kielipolitiikka on hyvin monimuotoinen ala, jota yhdistää pyrkimys vaikuttaa kielenkäyttöön jollakin tavalla. Monissa alan varhaisissa tutkimuksissa esitettiin, että kielipolitiikalla oli emansipatorinen tavoite, jolla pyrittiin antamaan alistetuille vähemmistöille voimaa taistella enemmistöpolitiikan julmuutta tai välinpitämättömyyttä vastaan. Vuosien mittaan kriittisissä tutkimuksissa on kuitenkin yhä useammin kyseenalaistettu se, kuka tarkalleen ottaen hyötyy vähemmistökielten edistämisestä. Voiko itse kieli, jota arvostetaan perinnön tunnuskuvana, joskus saada oman erillisen arvonsa? Voiko tämä arvo jopa olla merkittävämpi kuin ihmisten tulevaisuudennäkymien ja kyvykkyyksien parantamiseen liittyvät huolenaiheet? Seuraavassa vertailen tasapainoa ihmisten kyvykkyyksien ja itse kielen välillä useiden esimerkkitapausten kautta. Painotan erityisesti sitä, miten kasvava keskittyminen “uusiin puhujiin” vaikuttaa tähän tasapainoon.},

assess the impact of ChatGPT on translation within an Arab context. It primarily explored
the attitudes of a sample of translation teachers and students through semi-structured in-
terviews and projective techniques. Data collection included gathering information about
the advantages and challenges that ChatGPT, in comparison to Google Translate, had
introduced to the field of translation and translation teaching. The results indicated that
nearly all the participants were satisfied with ChatGPT. The results also revealed that most
students preferred ChatGPT over Google Translate, while most teachers favored Google
Translate. The study also found that the participants recognized both positive and negative
aspects of using ChatGPT in translation. Findings also indicated that ChatGPT, as a re-
cent AI-based translation-related technology, is more valuable for mechanical processes of
writing and editing translated texts than for tasks requiring judgment, such as fine-tuning
and double-checking. While it offers various advantages, AI also presents new challenges
that educators and stakeholders need to address accordingly.},

This book aims to contribute to the field of global literary studies with a more inclusive and decentralising approach. Specifically, it responds to a double demand: the need for expanding openness to other ways of seeing the global literary space by including multiple literary and cultural traditions and other interdisciplinary perspectives in the discussion, and the need for conceptual models and different case studies that will help develop a global approach in four key avenues of research: global translation flows and translation policies, the post-1989 novel as a global form, global literary environments, and a global perspective on film and cinema history. Gathering contributions from international scholars with expertise in various areas of research, the volume is structured around five target concepts: space, scale, time, connectivity, and agency. We also take gender and LGBTQ+ perspectives, as well as a digital approach.},

Moreover, historical perspectives on the transmission of sci- entific knowledge bave not generally acknowledged translation and its potential to generate epistemologica!, narrative and ideological shifts in the dissémination of scientific discourse. In contrast, social constructivist perspectives which account for human intervention and contingency in the représentation of science promote an analysis of translated scientific material that focuses on issues of rhetoric, ideology and translator 's agency. Drawing on the sociology and history of science, the history ofideas as well as varions frameworks for textual analysis, the contributors to this special issue engage with différent perspectives and approaches to help promote the visibility of scientific translation and shed light on its complex relationship with power and the construction of knowledge.},

	abstract = {The history of translation is seen variously as examining the role of translation in historical episodes or investigating the phenomenon or understanding of translation itself historically. These different historiographical perspectives involve potentially different research aims, approaches, concepts, methods and scholarly interlocutors. The paper focuses on this question of disciplinary commensurability in historical studies, and draws parallels between the history of translation and the history of science. Themes addressed include the tensions between local and global, national and transnational histories, and concomitant tensions between established historiographical norms and alternative, interdisciplinary approaches. It is argued that both the history of translation and the history of science are following a similar trajectory, towards a reflexive, transnational history that seeks productive modes of engagement with other historical disciplines. By bringing to the attention of translation scholars some of the key debates in the history of science and by identifying commonalities, this paper hopes to encourage historians of translation and of science to collaborate in the pursuit of a transnational history of science, the conceptual and methodological requirements of which could be usefully fulfilled by that combined expertise.},

However, among the numerous studies on language rights, on language policies or on immigrant incorporation, the key role of translation is usually not taken into consideration. Which linguistic and translational territoriality regimes are used by authorities to communicate with their multilingual populations? How do these different regimes relate to their linguistic and translational rights and their chances for participatory citizenship and integration? This essay discusses four prototypical regimes which may be used by authorities to communicate with their citizens. It will also try to hint at their possible impact on minorities’ linguistic and translational rights and integration.},

	abstract = {The contributions to this volume investigate relations of cohesion and coherence as well as instantiations of discourse phenomena and their interaction with information structure in multilingual contexts. Some contributions concentrate on procedures to analyze cohesion and coherence from a corpus-linguistic perspective. Others have a particular focus on textual cohesion in parallel corpora that include both originals and translated texts. Additionally, the papers in the volume discuss the nature of cohesion and coherence with implications for human and machine translation.{\textless}br{\textgreater}
    The contributors are experts on discourse phenomena and textuality who address these issues from an empirical perspective. The chapters in this volume are grounded in the latest research making this book useful to both experts of discourse studies and computational linguistics, as well as advanced students with an interest in these disciplines. We hope that this volume will serve as a catalyst to other researchers and will facilitate further advances in the development of cost-effective annotation procedures, the application of statistical techniques for the analysis of linguistic phenomena and the elaboration of new methods for data interpretation in multilingual corpus linguistics and machine translation.},

In our work, we attempt to gain empirical insights into variation in translation, focusing here on translation mode (translation vs. interpreting). Our goal is to discover features of translationese and interpretese that distinguish translated and interpreted output from comparable original text/speech as well as from each other at different linguistic levels. We use relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler Divergence) and visualization with word clouds. Our analysis shows differences in typical words between originals vs. non-originals as well as between translation modes both at lexical and grammatical levels.},

Our quantitative investigation underlines the disparity between languages, especially in terms of their resources, and calls into question the “language agnostic” status of current models and systems.

	abstract = {Abstract The translation policy model by González Núñez (2013, 475) comprises three elements, namely “translation management”, “translation practices”, and “translation beliefs”. While the first two elements of this model are straightforward and easy to study in top-down approaches, translation beliefs can relate both to policymakers and policy receivers. However, the distinction has not been clearly made in this model and the element of translation beliefs has been chiefly treated in the literature as though it comes from the top levels of policymaking, hence overlooking the bottom-up aspects of it (see González Núñez 2014, 2016; Li et al. 2017). In order to improve this model, the present paper draws on the audience reception theory (Hall 1973), and shows that the current translation policy model requires a fourth element that I would call ‘translation reception’. The paper draws on the findings of a reception-oriented case study on translation policies in provincial broadcasting in Iran. This study argues that a more inclusive model of translation policy should not only include the authority-level elements of translation management, translation practices, and translation beliefs, but also the element of translation reception on the part of policy receivers. This way, I hope, the end users’ involvement in and contribution to the translation policy network will not be overlooked in subsequent research.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            This article examines the status of translation policy as it relates to public service interfaces between the dominant Spanish-speaking sectors of society and speakers of some of the many indigenous languages of Latin America. The article focuses on Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay, and Peru is used as a case study based on recent first-hand research. Translation policy is inherently bound up with language policy, where the latter exists. However, there is variation from state to state as to whether language rights legislation has been passed, whether it is implemented through policy, and the extent to which translation policy is part of the legislative framework. The case of Peru illustrates the need for translation and interpreting (T\&I) services following conflicts and painful human rights infringements. Across the board, T\&I have hitherto been ad hoc practices, giving rise to translation policy de facto. Formalized T\&I training initiatives and legislative processes are now underway in Peru, and may give rise to explicit translation policies evolving there and elsewhere in the region in the future.},

Cross-Cultural Pragmatics is relevant for a variety of fields, such as pragmatics, applied linguistics, language learning and teaching, translation, intercultural communication and sociolinguistics. Written by two leading scholars in the field, this book offers an accessible overview of cross-cultural pragmatics, by providing insights into the theory and practice of systematically comparing language use in different cultural contexts. The authors provide a ground-breaking, language-anchored, strictly empirical and replicable framework applicable for the study of different datatypes and situations. The framework is illustrated with case studies drawn from a variety of linguacultures, such as English, Chinese, Japanese and German. In these case studies, the reader is provided with contrastive analyses of language use in important contexts such as globalised business, politics and classrooms. This book is essential reading for both academics and students},

Since then, the concept has travelled, and its meaning has expanded to describe other aspects of the international production, circulation and reception of texts, such as the symbolic and material spaces, capitals and practices involved in these processes. With the purpose of continuing to explore its explanatory power, in this article I argue intranslation has been the dominant process in Mexico’s translation policies of the 20th century. I examine three intranslation projects supported and/or implemented by the Mexican government. The article is divided into two main sections. The first section outlines the concepts of translation policy, intranslation and extranslation. The second section begins with an overview of the evolution of the Mexican publishing field. This is followed by a description of three translation projects supported by the Mexican government and by the analysis of the evolution of the roles and values attributed to translation.},

In light of this, the concept of translation policy should be developed so that it will be broad enough to account for diverse phenomena in different places with multiple agents, while retaining specific parameters that make the concept methodologically useful. This article will consider insights from Translation Studies and from other fields, especially from the field of Language Policy, in order to develop such a concept of translation policy. To illustrate how the understanding of translation policy that will be proposed may be used in a descriptive paradigm, the article will present translation policy in Scotland’s local government as a case study.},

	abstract = {A l’Europa actual, els idiomes de l’estat entren en contacte amb una gamma d’idiomes d’immigrants i un conjunt d’idiomes regionals. En aquest context, els encarregats d’elaborar polítiques s’enfronten a canvis en la demografia i en les actituds pel que fa als drets i la integració. Les investigacions actuals que aborden l’aspecte integrador de les polítiques lingüístiques en general passen per alt el paper exercit per la traducció en aquestes polítiques. Aquesta tesi procura aclarir aquesta funció sovint defugida. Amb aquesta finalitat, aquest estudi es concentra en la política de traducció, entesa com a suma de gestió, pràctica i idees de traducció. 
 
La tesi comença amb una revisió bibliogràfica de caràcter interdisciplinari en la qual s’exploren de manera crítica els escrits d’acadèmics en els camps del dret, les ciències polítiques, l’economia i els estudis de traducció pel que fa als drets de les minories lingüístiques. Després d’això es presenta una anàlisi de les obligacions al traduir en virtut del dret internacional, la qual cosa permet prosseguir amb un estudi de cas sobre la política de traducció en el sector públic del Regne Unit. En particular, aquest estudi de cas examina les polítiques de traducció que es reflecteixen en certes disposicions legislatives que s’apliquen al Regne Unit en la seva totalitat i també a les seves regions de forma específica. Tot això es desenvolupa en els capítols que abasten les polítiques de traducció trobades al govern (a nivell local), els serveis de salut i el sistema judicial. Aquestes polítiques de traducció no s’analitzen com un fet en si mateix, sinó per tal de recalcar que les decisions referents a la integració i la inclusió tenen un element de traducció que s’ha de tenir present.},

ring information. Our proposed framework aims
to improve overall content quality, demonstrated
through its effectiveness in enhancing the qual-
ity of Wikipedia articles at the section level. Al-
though We have shown a case study of knowledge
transfer from English to Hindi, WikiTransfer can
be adapted to transfer potential knowledge across
various language pairs.},

The idea of texts being inherently different despite being of high quality is not new. Translated texts, for example, are also different from original texts, a phenomenon referred to as ‘Translationese’. Research into Translationese has shown that, whereas humans cannot distinguish between translated and original text, computers have been trained to detect Translationese successfully. It remains to be seen whether the same can be done for what we call Post-editese. We first establish whether humans are capable of distinguishing post-edited texts from human translations, and then establish whether it is possible to build a supervised machine-learning model that can distinguish between translated and post-edited text.},

	abstract = {The Scientific Revolution of the 17th century not only revolutionized the English world view, it also brought about profound changes on the level of discourse. Through a process of grammatical metaphorization (Halliday and Martin 1993), primary experience was linguistically reconstrued to create a picture of a static objective universe from which all subjectivity was effectively removed. The Catholic cultures of Continental Europe were initially resistant to the scientific worldview, remaining loyal for political and religious reasons to the earlier humanistic model (Bennett 2007a, 2007b). Nevertheless, by the late 20th century, with the pres- sures of globalization, most had developed a scientific discourse of their own, essentially calqued from the English model. The fact that this discourse was borrowed however, rather than resulting from an internal process of evolution, has led to certain grammatical and rhetorical inconsistencies, which raise problems for translation. This paper discusses some of the technical issues besetting the English translator of Portuguese scientific texts, including difficul- ties related to nominalizations, impersonal verb structures and the intrusion of features from the traditional discourse. It also considers ethical and epistemological questions resulting from the process of linguistic colonization (Phillipson 1992, Pennycook 1994). Keywords:},

            The paper describes the text linguistic research of political texts in the field of Translation Studies and presents an overview of critical discourse analysis-based studies. First, the relationship between text, power and ideology and its implications on the role of translation are explored. This is followed by a review of a number of studies on the translation of political texts and on the power relations involved. The paper classifies such studies into the following six categories representing distinct research fields: translators' professional roles and politics; translators acting as mediators in situations of political conflict; translators' professional responsibilities and the strategies they apply; the inference of translators' own historical, social and cultural backgrounds; manipulation in the translation of literary texts and other text types; and critical discourse awareness in Translation Studies. The most recent studies in the above research fields and their results are also presented. It is concluded that these approaches exhibit quite varied research methods and their results are almost impossible to compare. With a view to the future development of this research field, it seems expedient to introduce a unified research theory, method and tool.},

This academic publishing practice creates a language barrier to the generation and transfer of scientific knowledge between communities with diverse linguistic backgrounds, hindering the ability of scholars and communities to address global challenges and achieve diversity and equity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). To overcome those barriers, publishers and journals should provide a fair system that supports non-native English speakers and disseminates knowledge across the globe. We surveyed policies of 736 journals in biological sciences to assess their linguistic inclusivity, identify predictors of inclusivity, and propose actions to overcome language barriers in academic publishing.},
